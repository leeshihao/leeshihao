## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying at Cornell Tech.

Coursework:

- Fall '24: Machine Learning Engineering, Networks and Markets (Game theory & Graph theory), HCI and Design, Privacy. 

I previously did my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley in CS + applied math, and did NLP research with the [Nucscholar](https://nucscholar.berkeley.edu/about/) team. 

- :crystal_ball: Iâ€™m currently volunteering with [AI Safety Asia](https://www.aisafety.asia/), a non-profit dedicated to enhancing AI safety (AIS) and governance in South-East Asia
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working on [PixelProof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzdwP9G2Vy4), a watermarking platform built on C2PA standard
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to rock climb, I made a ML [rock climbing move generator](https://github.com/callaunchpad/therock-website)!
